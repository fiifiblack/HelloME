# HelloME

Hello Coders,

My name is Evans and I am learning how to use GitHub. I did an informal way of getting my codes online, but I want to follow the formal steps
available here to ensure that I am doing the right thing.  I have added this text as a branch from my master. Wish me luck and be awesome.
